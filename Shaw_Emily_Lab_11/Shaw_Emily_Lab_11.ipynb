    "I mostly used Dr. Gibson's example as a reference. I finally figured out how to clear the previous question with the next question button, but I couldn't figure out how to make the new question and the new buttons appear. Honestly, I had a lot of final projects and presentations this week so I didn't get to work on this as much as I had hoped. However, if I had more time, I would've added a label that changed based on the number of points gained and it would change each round. Once I would have figured out how to add the new question and answers, it would've been simply to add the label with the text being the new score each round. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes me wonder how you could make it so that you only get points if chosen correctly on the first try, because right now, the only way for the next question button to pop up is if you answer correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest issue I had with the parts I tried was with making the new question to show up with its answers. I tried destroying different widgets but the only thing that seemed to work was destroying the root. But if I continued doing that, I'd need a new root for each question and it seems like there must be an easier way to accomplish that and I just don't know about it. I finally cleared the first question by destroying the old root and creating a new one, but since I was using a new root, I couldn't reuse the same functions that I made that worked for the first round.
